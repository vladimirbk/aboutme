                <h2>Sports</h2>
                <p>My favourite sport is boxing, since i trained it a lot. Not only i like to do it, i also like to  watch it.In addition to that i also like training with weights, which i had to quit, due to back injury. I also like to play soccer with my friends, however compared to them i have ZERO skills.</p>
                <h2>Video games</h2>
                <p>Sometimes it takes a lot of time from me, but in the last two weeks, i managed to resist my desire to play a single minute on a computer, due to a lot of assignments and tests i had in university. My favourite game is Battlefield 3, although i am not good at it.</p>
                <h2>Movies</h2>
                <p>I don't have a favourite genre, however i have couple of favourite movies. That list includes "Avatar" (2009), "Incredibles 2" (2018) and "Venom" (2018).</p>
                <h2>And, of course i love to hang out with my friends</h2>
